## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#package "here" will help with navagating the working directory in R markdown which is not technically possible in R markdown 

```{r new title goes here, }
library(here)
edidiv<- read.csv(file="Sept_28_Intro_to_R/edidiv.csv")
edidiv2 <- read.csv(file=here::here("Sept_28_Intro_to_R", "edidiv.csv"))
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
